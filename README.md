# Number Cruncher

Project itself was build in programming competition "CovHack". It took about ~6 hours to finish  

## Built With
* [P5.js](https://p5js.org) - JS client-side library for creating graphic experiences

### What have I learned?
* This mini game was more about friendly competition against others
* It was more about idea brainstorming
